## OOP-22-1
Wellcome to group 1 lap of the OOP course at ELTE, here you will find all the laps updated week by week and you will find some extra usefull informations!

* **How to get started with C++:**
  1. You will need to install the comiler, installing the compiler is not hard, all you need is to follow the instructions in this link https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/
  2. You can choose any of the pre-built toolchains or packages and follow the installation link (I am using Mingw-builds)
  3. After successfull installation you will need to add the *bin* file to your path:
      1. First go to the C drive -> Program Files (x86) -> (the folder of the pre-built toolchain or package that you installed) -> (then look for a file calld *bin*)
      2. Copy this path
      3. Go to Start -> Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables , here you will see the PATH variable, double click on it -> click new -> past the copied path (that you did copy on step b)
      
  4. To test that you successfully installed the compiler go to CMD and type ```g++ -version``` if you found the verstion of your gcc then you are ready to go ;)
  5. I am going to be using VScode, you can use it as well, here is the download link https://code.visualstudio.com/download, **NOTE you are required to use Codeblocks to write your exams and assignments.**
  6. **NOTE** the previous steps where for Windows users, for linux users follow the steps here https://youtu.be/4e7pa6Pf3VQ, and for MAC users follow those steps https://youtu.be/-edTHKZdkjo
